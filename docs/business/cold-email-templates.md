## Template 1: Investor Outreach (Angel/VC)

**Subject:** Commission-free QR ordering for 150,000+ Egyptian restaurants

**Email Body:**

Hi [Investor Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm [Your Name], founder of [Company Name] - Egypt's first commission-free QR ordering platform designed specifically for dine-in restaurants.

**The Problem**
Egyptian restaurants are losing 15-25% of revenue to delivery platform commissions (Talabat, Otta). For a typical restaurant doing 200K EGP/month, that's 30-50K EGP gone in fees alone. There's no affordable solution for dine-in digital ordering.

**Our Solution**
Flat-rate pricing: 50-100 EGP/month. No commissions, no per-order fees, no hidden costs.

Key features:
- QR code ordering (table-linked)
- Real-time order tracking
- Waiter Call button (0% competitors have this)
- Customer reviews & analytics

**Why Now**
- 150,000+ restaurants in Egypt
- $10.35B market growing 15.2% CAGR
- Zero competition in commission-free dine-in
- Digital transformation accelerating post-COVID

**Traction**
- MVP 99.2% complete (323 tasks delivered)
- Go backend with event sourcing
- Astro + React frontend (SSG architecture)
- Ready for pilot deployment

**The Ask**
Seeking 900K EGP at 3M EGP pre-money valuation (23.1% equity) for 18-month runway to reach profitability.

**Key Metrics**
- LTV:CAC: 21x (vs 3x industry standard)
- Payback: 6 months
- Breakeven: Month 11
- Year 5 projection: 3.55M EGP ARR

I'd love to walk you through the product or share our full pitch deck. Are you open to a 15-minute call this week?
