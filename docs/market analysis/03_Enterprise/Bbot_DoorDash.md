## Competitive Verdict

**Overall Assessment:** Bbot was a promising contactless ordering platform acquired by DoorDash for $88M in 2022. While its technology (no-app ordering, commission-free model) was innovative, acquisition by DoorDash creates concerns for restaurants about competitor ownership and data control.

**Market Fit:** Medium for restaurants wanting contactless ordering. Low for operations avoiding DoorDash relationship.

**Key Differentiator**: Web-based ordering (no app) with commission-free model, now part of DoorDash.

**Best For:** Restaurants comfortable with DoorDash relationship wanting contactless ordering.

**Not For:** Restaurants wanting guaranteed independence from DoorDash or prioritizing data ownership.

**Note**: Post-acquisition status uncertain. Consider independent alternatives for guaranteed autonomy.
