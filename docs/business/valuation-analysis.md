## Valuation Methods

### Method 1: Cost-to-Duplicate (Replacement Cost)

**What it would cost to rebuild from scratch today:**

```
Development:
- 323 tasks × 2 hours average × 320 EGP/hr = 206,720 EGP
- Project management (10%): 20,672 EGP
- Testing & QA (15%): 31,008 EGP
- Infrastructure setup (5%): 10,336 EGP

TOTAL REPLACEMENT COST: ~268,736 EGP
```

**Weighted Average Hourly Rate Breakdown:**
| Role | Hourly Rate (EGP) | Weight |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Senior Go Developer | 350 | 40% |
| Senior React/Frontend | 320 | 40% |
| Mid-level Full Stack | 200 | 20% |
| **Weighted Average** | **320** | |

This sets your **FLOOR valuation** - the absolute minimum the company is worth.

### Method 2: The Berkus Method (Adjusted for Egypt)

Dave Berkus's method assigns value to 5 risk categories:

| Category | Egypt Range (EGP) | Your Assessment | Value |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Sound Idea (basic concept) | 0 - 2,500,000 | QR ordering is proven globally | 1,000,000 |
| **Prototype/MVP** | 0 - 2,500,000 | Nearly complete product | **2,000,000** |
| Quality Team (reduces execution risk) | 0 - 2,500,000 | Technical founder background | 1,000,000 |
| Strategic Relationships | 0 - 2,500,000 | Restaurant connections? | 500,000 |
| Product Launch/Revenue | 0 - 2,500,000 | Pre-revenue stage | 500,000 |

**Berkus Valuation: 5,000,000 EGP**

---

### Method 3: Scorecard Method (Comparables)

Compare to typical Egyptian pre-revenue SaaS startups:

```
Base Average Pre-Seed Valuation in Egypt: 4,000,000 EGP

Adjustment Factors:
```

| Factor | Weight | Your Score (1-5) | Multiplier | Impact |
|--------|--------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Team (technical founder) | 30% | 4 | 1.2 | +0.36x |
| Market Size (Egypt restaurants) | 25% | 3 | 1.0 | +0.25x |
| **Product (MVP complete)** | 20% | 5 | 1.5 | **+0.30x** |
| Competition (differentiation) | 15% | 4 | 1.2 | +0.18x |
| Traction (users/revenue) | 10% | 2 | 0.8 | -0.02x |

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4,000,000 EGP
× 1.07 (total multiplier)
= 4,280,000 EGP
```

**Scorecard Valuation: ~4,300,000 EGP**

---

### Method 4: Revenue Multiple (Future Projection)

Once you have revenue, valuation becomes:

```
Valuation = Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) × Multiple

Egyptian B2B SaaS multiples:
- Early stage (pre-profit): 2-4x
- Growth stage: 4-8x
- Mature stage: 8-12x
```

**Example at Year 3:**
```
ARR: 705,516 EGP
Multiple: 3x (early stage)
Valuation: 2,116,548 EGP
```

**Example at Year 5:**
```
ARR: 3,550,236 EGP
Multiple: 5x (growth stage)
Valuation: 17,751,180 EGP
```

3. **18-month runway** - sufficient to reach profitability
