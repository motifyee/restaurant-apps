**Key Differentiator**: End-to-end hardware + software bundle with venue/stadium specialization and POS-agnostic integration.

**Best For**: Multi-location QSR chains, fast-casual restaurants, stadiums/venues, food courts, and operations wanting complete kiosk solutions with upselling capabilities.

**Not For**: Single-location restaurants (hardware cost prohibitive), small cafes, international venues (US-only), or operations wanting software-only solutions.
